# PreemAPI-
Hi, I'm Jacob!
or "PreemAPI – This API is Preem, smooth as chrome."

👾 Who am I?
I’m a self-taught web developer with a passion for learning and experimenting with code. I’m on a journey to blend UX/UI design and web development, and I'm excited to create projects that live at the intersection of creativity and technology.
UX/UI Designer based in Auckland, with a completed project under my belt and a new one in progress.
I love mixing creativity with code, finding ways to merge front-end development with UX principles.
My background includes a degree in Digital Design, making me comfortable with 3D asset creation. I’m eager to incorporate those skills into websites and app designs.
💻 What I'm Working On
Building a personal website to showcase my UX work and digital design projects.
Exploring HTML and Python through a 100 Days of Code challenge to get hands-on with both front-end and back-end development.
Learning to talk the same language as developers, which helps me collaborate better across disciplines—and it’s a fun hobby, too!

🎯 Current Goals

Front-end Development: Improve my knowledge of JavaScript and React.
Back-end Exploration: Get familiar with APIs, databases, and Python-based frameworks.
3D Integration: Incorporate 3D assets in web or app designs to push my creativity even further.
Personal Brand: Build meaningful connections in the tech space, grow my network, and share my learning journey.

🚀 Fun Facts About Me
I’m using coding games to sharpen my problem-solving and typing skills (Typing of the Dead, anyone?).
You might catch me learning guitar between coding sessions—life’s all about balance! 🎸
